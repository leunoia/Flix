### Notes
This exercise was extremely fun and I felt myself becoming more familiar with the design process. I did face one challenge when implementing the bonus feature which was trying to get the UICollectionView index. At first, I didn't know how to do this but after a little bit of researching I was able to figure it out.

### Notes
In general iOS developement is a completely different way of thinking for me. At first, getting used to the idea of views and what they represent was a bit strange but now it makes a lot more sense to me. There are also a few syntactical parts of Swift that I will need to research on my own.
